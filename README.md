## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Seasoned iOS Developer with 14+ Years of Expertise.

With over 14 years of hands-on experience in iOS
development, Iâ€™ve successfully navigated both freelance
projects and led development teams to deliver high-quality
solutions. My expertise in UNIX systems enables me to
efficiently manage lower-level aspects of the platform.
Outside of work, I dedicate time to mentoring, sharing my
passion for coding and helping the next generation of
developers grow.
